Put any notes for us here.
1. I added Axios for data fetching

2. I also updated to react 16.3.2 so that I could use the new Context api in place of Redux. This was my first time actually using the context api and a good amount of my time was put into learning how it works!

3. I skipped being able to search by planet as I was not in able to come up with a clever way to do this in the timeframe I had :P
